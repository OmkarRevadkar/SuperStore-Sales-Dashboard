Created interactive dashboard to track and analyse online sales data.
Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customisation using filters and slicers.
Created connections, joined new tables, performed calculations to manipulate data and enabled user driven parameters for visualizations.
Used different types of customised visualizations (stacked bar and column chart, area chart, donut chart, line chart, map, tree map, cards and slicer).
Although, we never rely on the forecast made in PowerBI, tried to avail the forecast feature and forecasted sales for the next 15 days and just got aquainted with concepts like forecast length, seasonality and confidence interval.
